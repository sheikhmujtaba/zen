    It is a website where people try to restyle the zen garden webpage by using css and try to make it look as intriguing as possible. Looking at the different webpages on zengarden, I was impressed by the prowess of CSS and how it can be used to create highly interactive webpages.

    Out of all the webpages that I saw <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/219/">Steel</a>
        was the the most interesting. Whenever I hovered onto the  paragraphs, they dropped down, and when I removed the cursor, they went back to their original place.
        He used the hoveraable drop down on every single paragraph with a great contrast between the colors, which made the website look very interactive.

    From the reading that I did, the person added a background image tag to his webpage and optimised it to fit into the webpage properly.

    Something that really caught my attention was the dropdown paragraphs, this was not something that I read in the book and it was really impressive. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/CSS/css_dropdowns.asp">Drop down bar</a>
